# Testing Edge Website Development Plan (Master Document)

## Introduction

The following documents outline the comprehensive plan for designing, developing, and launching the official website for "Testing Edge" (also referred to as "Testing for Hire" in source documents), a software testing consultancy.

The primary goal is to create a professional, informative, and conversion-focused online presence that effectively communicates the consultancy's value proposition, services, and expertise. The website must be designed and implemented using a **mobile-first approach**.

This master document serves as a table of contents, linking to the detailed planning documents that guide the project from conception through launch and maintenance.
