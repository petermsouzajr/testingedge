      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our website is hosted on infrastructure that may be located globally.
        Furthermore, we utilize third-party service providers, such as Resend
        for email delivery, whose servers may be located outside of your home
        country (e.g., in the United States). Therefore, your information,
        including personal data (name, email address, message content submitted
        via the contact form, and technical data), may be transferred to — and
        maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province,
        country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection
        laws may differ.

      <p className="mb-4">
        We rely on the security measures and data protection practices of these
        third-party service providers regarding any international data
        transfers. By using our Service, you consent to such transfers, provided
        that appropriate safeguards are maintained by these providers (such as
        adherence to standard contractual clauses or other recognized transfer
        mechanisms where applicable).
      </p>
