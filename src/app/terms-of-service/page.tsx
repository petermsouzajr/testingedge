        Effective Date: April 18, 2025
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR
        WEBSITE AND SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL TERMS
        INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO
        NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR WEBSITE OR SERVICES.

        Welcome to Testing Edge (&ldquo;Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo;
        &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). These Terms of Service
        (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of our website
        located at https://petermsouzajr.com/testing-edge (the
        &ldquo;Website&rdquo; ) and the services we provide (collectively, the
        &ldquo;Service&rdquo;).

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">
        1. Agreement to Terms
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are
        using the Service on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to
        these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the
        authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case,
        &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; will refer to that
        organization.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">
        2. Changes to Terms or Services
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do
        so, we&rsquo;ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the
        Website or through other communications. It&rsquo;s important that you
        review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use
        the Service after we have posted modified Terms on the Website, you are
        indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If
        you don&rsquo;t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may
        not the Service anymore. Because our Service is evolving over time we
        may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time
        and without notice, at our sole discretion.
