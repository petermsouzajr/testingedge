# 01: Technical Specifications - Testing for Hire Website

## 1. Mobile-First Approach

- **Design Philosophy:** Design and develop for mobile screens first, then scale up to tablet and desktop. Ensure content hierarchy, navigation, and interactions are optimized for touchscreens and smaller viewports.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilize fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes.
- **Performance:** Optimize assets (images, scripts, CSS) aggressively for fast loading times, especially on mobile networks. Aim for LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1 (Core Web Vitals).

## 2. Technology Stack (Recommendation: Static Site Generator)

- **Rationale:** A static site offers excellent performance, security, and lower maintenance overhead, suitable for a consultancy website primarily focused on information delivery.
- **Recommended SSG:**
  - **Astro:** Excellent performance, component-based (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.), good for content-heavy sites. Mobile-first friendly.
  - **Eleventy (11ty):** Simple, flexible, data-driven. Less opinionated.
  - **Next.js (Static Export):** Powerful React framework, can export statically. Might be overkill if no complex dynamic features are planned initially.
- **CSS Framework/Methodology:**
  - **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first, highly customizable, excellent for rapid development and responsive design. Integrates well with SSGs.
  - **Custom CSS/Sass with BEM:** More traditional approach, good for maintainability if preferred. Requires careful planning for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript:** Use sparingly. Employ frameworks/libraries primarily for interactive elements (e.g., mobile navigation toggles, form validation) rather than full page rendering. Consider vanilla JS or lightweight libraries like Alpine.js.

## 3. Hosting & Deployment

- **Hosting Platform:**
  - **Netlify / Vercel:** Excellent choices for static sites/SSGs. Offer CI/CD integration, global CDN, free tiers, HTTPS, and easy deployment from Git.
  - **Cloudflare Pages:** Similar benefits to Netlify/Vercel.
  - **AWS S3 + CloudFront / Google Cloud Storage + CDN:** More manual setup but highly scalable and cost-effective.
- **Deployment:** Implement CI/CD pipeline via GitHub/GitLab actions integrated with the hosting platform. Deployments triggered automatically on pushes to the main branch after tests pass.

## 4. Domain Name

- Ensure the primary domain (e.g., `testingforhire.com` or similar) is secured and configured correctly with the hosting provider.
- Implement proper DNS records (A, CNAME, MX for email if applicable).

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Image Optimization:** Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF), lazy loading, responsive images (`srcset`), and compression.
- **Asset Bundling & Minification:** Configure build tools (via SSG) to bundle and minify CSS, JS.
- **Code Splitting:** Load JavaScript modules only when needed (if applicable).
- **Caching:** Leverage browser caching and CDN caching effectively.
- **Font Loading:** Optimize web font loading strategy (e.g., `font-display: swap`).

## 6. SEO Foundations

- **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`).
- **Meta Tags:** Implement relevant title tags, meta descriptions for each page.
- **Open Graph / Twitter Cards:** Include meta tags for social sharing previews.
- **Schema Markup:** Add basic Organization and Service schema where appropriate.
- **`robots.txt` & `sitemap.xml`:** Generate and configure these files.

## 7. Security

- **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS sitewide (handled by modern hosting platforms).
- **Dependencies:** Keep all dependencies (NPM packages, etc.) up-to-date using tools like Dependabot or Snyk.
- **Contact Form Security:** Use serverless functions (e.g., Netlify Functions) or a third-party service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms) for secure form submission handling. Implement basic spam protection (e.g., honeypot field, CAPTCHA if necessary).
- **Headers:** Implement security-related HTTP headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).

## 8. Accessibility (WCAG)

- Adhere to WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA guidelines throughout development.
- Ensure proper color contrast, keyboard navigability, focus states, ARIA attributes where needed, and semantic HTML structure.
- Test with automated tools (e.g., axe-core) and manual checks (keyboard navigation, screen reader testing).

## 9. Analytics

- Integrate a privacy-respecting analytics solution (e.g., Plausible, Fathom) or Google Analytics (ensure GDPR compliance if used).
