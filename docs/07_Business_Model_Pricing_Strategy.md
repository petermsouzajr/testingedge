_Note: Specific project pricing is calculated using these parameters combined with project-specific inputs (feature count, complexity, coverage targets, etc.) via an internal calculator tool._

## 3. Measuring Project Size & Scope

Project size is assessed using factors like:

- **Feature Count / User Stories**: Primary driver for testing effort.
- **Codebase Complexity**: Multiplier (1=Simple, 1.5=Moderate, 2=Complex) adjusting base hours.
- **Browser/Device Scope**: Number of targets impacting Playwright effort.
- **Compliance/Documentation Needs**: Specific requirements for WCAG, SOC2, GWT, TestRail, How-Tos.
- **Performance/Load Scope**: Scale of testing based on user load/transactions.

These factors categorize projects (Small, Medium, Large) and inform the selection of appropriate service packages and pricing ranges derived from the configuration parameters.

## 4. Service Package Overview (Pricing Derived from Calculator)

While specific prices are generated by the internal calculator based on detailed scope, the previously defined packages serve as templates:

- **Core Quality Suite**: Foundational Cypress testing (~80% target), Jest/Vitest, TestRail, How-To docs. _Target Price Range: $15k-$25k (Medium Complexity)_.
- **Comprehensive Testing Bundle**: Core Suite + Playwright cross-browser testing, GWT docs. _Target Price Range: $25k-$35k (Medium Complexity)_.
- **Accessibility Assurance Package**: Focused WCAG testing (Tier 1 or 2) + core Cypress (~50% target) & docs. _Target Price Range: $20k-$30k (Medium Complexity, depends on Tier)_.
- **Performance & Load Optimization Package**: Performance/Load testing (Tier 1 or 2) + core Cypress (~50% target) & docs. _Target Price Range: $22k-$35k (Medium Complexity, depends on Tier)_.
- **Enterprise Compliance Add-On**: SOC2 Prep Testing (Tier 1 or 2) added to another package. _Target Price Add-on: $8k-$15k (depends on Tier)_.

_Note: The price ranges above are illustrative for typical "medium complexity" projects and should be confirmed using the detailed calculator._
