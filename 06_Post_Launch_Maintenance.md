# 06: Post-Launch Maintenance Plan - Testing for Hire Website

## 1. Regular Updates

- **Dependency Updates:** Regularly (e.g., monthly or quarterly) review and update project dependencies (NPM packages for SSG, CSS framework, JS libraries) to patch security vulnerabilities and benefit from improvements. Use tools like `npm outdated` or automated services like Dependabot/Renovate. Test thoroughly after updates on a staging environment before deploying to production.
- **Platform Updates:** Stay informed about updates to the hosting platform or SSG framework that might require configuration changes or offer performance/security benefits.

## 2. Backups

- **Code:** Version control (Git repository on GitHub/GitLab) serves as the primary code backup. Ensure regular pushes.
- **Content:** If using Markdown/data files in Git, content is backed up with code. If using a Headless CMS, ensure the CMS provider has adequate backup procedures or implement manual backups.
- **Hosting Platform:** Most modern platforms (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages) manage infrastructure backups and offer deployment rollbacks. Understand the platform's specific capabilities.
- **Environment Variables:** Keep a secure, offline copy of essential environment variables (`JWT_SECRET`, etc.) in case of platform issues.

## 3. Monitoring

- **Uptime Monitoring:** Set up external uptime monitoring (e.g., UptimeRobot, Better Uptime - free tiers available) to get immediate alerts if the site goes down.
- **Analytics Review:** Regularly (e.g., monthly) review website analytics to understand user behavior, traffic sources, popular content, and conversion rates (contact form submissions). Identify areas for improvement or potential issues.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Periodically re-run PageSpeed Insights / Lighthouse tests (e.g., quarterly or after significant changes) to ensure performance remains optimal.
- **Security Monitoring:** Use tools like Snyk or GitHub's security alerts (Dependabot) to continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Review hosting platform security notices.
- **Search Console Monitoring:** Regularly check Google Search Console (and other relevant webmaster tools) for crawl errors, indexing issues, security warnings, or manual actions.
- **Error Monitoring:** Consider integrating a client-side error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar - free tiers often available) to catch JavaScript errors experienced by users.

## 4. Content Management

- Plan for adding new content (blog posts, portfolio items, updated service descriptions) if applicable.
- Establish a clear process for updating existing content (e.g., pricing adjustments, contact info) as the business evolves.
- Ensure content updates are reviewed before publishing.

## 5. Bug Fixing

- Address any bugs reported post-launch promptly, prioritizing based on severity (e.g., broken contact form, authentication issues are critical).
- Maintain a simple bug tracking system if needed (e.g., GitHub Issues).
- Follow the standard development workflow (branch, fix, test, PR, merge, deploy) for bug fixes.

## 6. SEO Optimization (Ongoing)

- Based on analytics and Search Console data, identify opportunities to optimize content for relevant keywords or improve page rankings.
- Consider building backlinks (ethically) over time.
- Keep content fresh, relevant, and accurate.
- Stay informed about major search engine algorithm updates.

## 7. Periodic Reviews

- Conduct a full site review annually or bi-annually to assess:
  - Design relevance and modernity.
  - Content accuracy and completeness.
  - Overall performance and user experience.
  - Effectiveness against business goals (lead generation, credibility).
  - Technology stack relevance (is the SSG/framework still suitable?).
- Plan for potential redesigns or major updates every few years based on these reviews.
