# Landing Page Content Alignment Checklist (vs. 02_Landing_Page_Content_Sections.md)

This checklist outlines areas where `src/app/page.tsx` needs alignment with the content plan in `docs/02_Landing_Page_Content_Sections.md`.

## Section Comparison & Gaps

**1. Hero Section:**

- **Docs:** Suggests several headline options. Current headline "Ship Reliable Web Apps Faster" is good and benefit-driven. Sub-headline matches example closely. Mentions a Visual (graphic/image/video).
- **Code:** Implements headline and sub-headline well. Has a `div` placeholder `[Professional Graphic/Image Placeholder]`.
- **Gap:** [ ] The visual element (`[Professional Graphic/Image Placeholder]`) needs to be implemented.

**2. Problem / Solution Section:**

- **Docs:** Lists specific pain points (flaky tests, WCAG, SOC2, performance, QA hindrance). Suggests concise solution text connecting to pains.
- **Code:** Implements this section very well. Uses `<h2>Overcome Your Testing Challenges</h2>`. Lists almost identical pain points. Solution text in the green box aligns well with the suggestion.
- **Gap:** Looks good, closely matches the docs.

**3. Services Overview Section:**

- **Docs:** Suggests cards/icons for Test Automation, Essential Documentation, Accessibility Testing, Performance Testing, SOC2 Prep Testing. Mentions specific details (tools, coverage, WCAG AA) and **Tiers** for Accessibility, Performance, and SOC2. Includes an optional "Key Tools" sub-section.
- **Code:** Implements 3 cards: "Test Automation", "Essential Documentation", and "Specialized Testing". The "Specialized Testing" card groups Accessibility, Performance, and SOC2 Prep together, mentioning "Tiers Available". Placeholder `[Icon]` is used for each card. Includes the "Key Tools We Master" sub-section.
- **Gap:**
  - [ ] Placeholder icons (`[Icon]`) need replacing.
  - [ ] Review: Decide if grouping under "Specialized Testing" is sufficient or if Accessibility, Performance, SOC2 Prep should be separated (as docs imply).
  - [ ] Consider how/if to visually represent the **Tier** concept mentioned in the text.

**4. "Why Choose Us?" / Differentiators Section:**

- **Docs:** Lists several points: 10+ Yrs Experience, Modern Tooling, ROI Focus, Comprehensive Approach, Direct Collaboration, Structured & Transparent.
- **Code:** Implements this section well, titled "Why Partner with Testing Edge?". The bullet points closely match the documentation points.
- **Gap:** Looks good, closely matches the docs.

**5. How It Works / Process Section:**

- **Docs:** Recommends a 4-step process: Discovery Call, Tailored Proposal, Execution & Delivery, Handover & Support.
- **Code:** Implements this section well, titled "Our Engagement Process". It uses the exact 4 steps suggested in the docs with brief descriptions.
- **Gap:** Looks good, closely matches the docs.

**6. Post-Project Support Section:**

- **Docs:** Suggests mentioning a "1-Month Project Warranty", listing named Support Tiers ("Essential Maintenance", "Growth & Stability", "Strategic Partnership") with commitment lengths, and a CTA to ask during consultation.
- **Code:** Implements this section titled "Ongoing Support & Maintenance". It has generic text: "Flexible options... We ensure your testing assets remain valuable long-term." and a comment `{/* Add details or link if needed */}`.
- **Gap:** [ ] **Major Gap:** This section needs significant updates:
  _ [ ] Add mention of the **1-Month Project Warranty**.
  _ [ ] Add the specific named **Support Tiers** (Essential Maintenance, Growth & Stability, Strategic Partnership) and potentially commitment lengths. \* [ ] Add the **CTA** to ask about support options during consultation.

**7. Final Call to Action (CTA) Section:**
