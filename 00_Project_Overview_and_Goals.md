# 00: Project Overview and Goals - Testing for Hire Website

## 1. Project Vision

To create a highly professional, mobile-first website for the "Testing for Hire" consultancy. The site will serve as the primary online presence, effectively communicating the consultancy's expertise, specialized services (Cypress, Playwright, Jest/Vitest, Documentation, Accessibility, Performance, SOC2 Support), and unique value proposition to potential clients. It should build credibility, generate leads, and clearly present service packages and pricing philosophy.

## 2. Target Audience

The website should appeal to decision-makers at various company types:

- **Startups:** Seeking cost-effective, foundational testing solutions (e.g., Core Quality Suite).
- **Mid-Sized Companies (SaaS, E-commerce):** Needing robust, comprehensive testing, cross-browser support, and potentially specialized services like accessibility or performance (e.g., Comprehensive Bundle, Accessibility/Performance Packages).
- **Enterprises & Regulated Industries (Fintech, Healthcare):** Requiring formal documentation (GWT), compliance support (SOC2), and highly reliable testing frameworks (e.g., Comprehensive Bundle + Add-ons).
- **Companies prioritizing Inclusivity/High Traffic:** Specifically interested in Accessibility or Performance packages.
- **Companies preparing for Audits:** Interested in the SOC2 Compliance Add-On.
